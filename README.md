# Ten Minute Physics - Vulkan (Rust)
This will eventually be my exploration of [Ten Minute Physics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html) projects in Rust once things are setup enough through the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

Right now structure is a mess while all the pieces come together. Everything will be continuously refactored and altered with pretty much every commit.
